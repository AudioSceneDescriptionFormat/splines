Source Files for the Documentation
==================================

The online documentation is available at https://splines.readthedocs.io/.

Most of the content is available as [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
files (with the `.ipynb` suffix), just have a look at the sub-directories
[euclidean](euclidean) and [rotation](rotation).

If you don't have Jupyter installed on your computer, don't worry,
all notebooks can also be edited and executed online thanks to *Binder*:
