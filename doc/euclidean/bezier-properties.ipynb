    "   given a *control polygon* consisting of a sequence of $d + 1$ vertices.\n",

    "   lies on the curve (at its start and end, respectively),\n",
    "   while the other vertices in general don't\n",

    "2. A piecewise polynomial curve consisting of multiple segments,\n",
    "   each of them constructed from a separate Bernstein polynomial.\n",
    "   The start and end points of neighboring control polygons typically coincide,\n",
    "   leading to $C^0$ continuity.\n",
