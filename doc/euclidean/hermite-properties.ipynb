    "Hermite splines are interpolating polynomial splines,\n",
    "where for each polynomial segment,\n",
    "the desired value at the start and end is given (obviously!),\n",
    "as well as the values of a certain number of derivatives\n",
    "at the start and/or the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most commonly, *cubic* (= degree 3) Hermite splines are used.\n",
    "Cubic polynomials have 4 coefficients to be chosen freely,\n",
    "and those are determined for each segment of a cubic Hermite spline\n",
    "by providing 4 pieces of information:\n",
    "the function value and the first derivative,\n",
    "both at the beginning and the end of the segment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other degrees of Hermite splines are possible (but much rarer),\n",
    "for example *quintic* (= degree 5) Hermite splines,\n",
    "which are defined by the second derivatives\n",
    "at the start and end of each segment,\n",
    "on top of the first derivatives and the function values (6 values in total).\n",
    "\n",
    "Hermite splines with even degrees are probably still rarer.\n",
    "For example, *quadratic* (= degree 2) Hermite splines can be constructed\n",
    "by providing the function values at both beginning and end of each segment,\n",
    "but only one first derivative, either at the beginning or at the end\n",
    "(leading to 3 values in total).\n",
    "Make sure not to confuse them with *quartic* (= degree 4) Hermite splines,\n",
    "which are defined by 5 values per segment:\n",
    "function value and first derivative at both ends,\n",
    "and one of the second derivatives."
