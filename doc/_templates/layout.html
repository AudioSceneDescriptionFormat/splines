{#-
Github's issue search is somewhat fuzzy, but we would like an exact match for issue-term.
Spaces, commas, hyphens, slashes etc. would be treated as search term separators,
which might lead to the wrong comments being included.  Therefore, we are replacing
some characters with underscores, and "urlencode" will take care of the rest.
